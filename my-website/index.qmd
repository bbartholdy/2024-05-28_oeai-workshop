Hello, I'm Emmett, a construction worker and totally normal guy.
My favourite TV show is 'Where are my Pants?' and my favourite song
is 'Everything is Awesome'. I also like to drink reasonably-priced coffee. My best
friends are Lucy, Vitruvius, Batman, Princess Unkitty, Benny, Good Cop,
and Planty.
